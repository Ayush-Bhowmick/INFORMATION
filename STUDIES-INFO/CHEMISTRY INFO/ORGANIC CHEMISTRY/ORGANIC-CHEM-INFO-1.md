# GENERAL INFO :
- `Homologous` - having the same relation, relative position, or structure.
- `Substituent` - an atom or group of atoms taking the place of another atom or group or occupying a specified position in a molecule.
- `Moiety` - Part of a molecule
-  a `substrate` is typically the chemical species being observed in a chemical reaction, which is organic in nature and reacts with a reagent to generate a product. S + C -> P + C ; S,P,C=Substrate, Product and catalyst resp.
- A `Reagent` is a substance or compound added to a system to cause a chemical reaction, or added to test if a reaction occurs.A `reagent` is a substance or compound added to a system to cause a chemical reaction, or added to test if a reaction occurs. The terms reactant and reagent are often used interchangeablyâ€”however, a reactant is more specifically a substance consumed in the course of a chemical reaction.
- `ENTHALPY` - It is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. It is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume. - 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy
- `Catalysis`  is the increase in the rate of a chemical reaction due to the participation of an additional substance called a `catalyst`, which is not consumed in the catalyzed reaction and can continue to act repeatedly. Often only tiny amounts of catalyst are required in principle.
- `Aqua regia ` - (from Latin, lit. "royal water" or "king's water") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid,[1] optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid, so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum, though not all metals.
- `Ligand` - In coordination chemistry, a ligand is an ion or molecule (functional group) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand's electron pairs.
