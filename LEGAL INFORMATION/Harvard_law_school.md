## JUSTICE WITH MICHAEL SANDERS

THE MORAL SIDE OF JUSTICE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY&list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6

- Killing the one, sparring the five
- 911 + Pensylvania fields

-human beings are animals. when they are hungry, they kill and eat. if they are threatened, they kill and survive. utilitarianism is great unless you become the weak minority. there's no moral, but only delusion of having moral. follow your instinct. instinct is the only true moral which is written in our genes. it is the law of nature. the only rule you need to follow. everything else is bullshit.

- Political Philosophy

- `PHRASES`
    - Who's willing to volunteer a reason
    - It wouldn't be right to kill five, if you could kill one instead.
    - It is better to kill one so that five can live.
    - I think that same type of mentality justifies genocide and totalitarianism - in order to save one type of race you wipe out the other.
    - To prevent the horrors of genocide, you would crash into the five and kill them -> Presumably yes.
    - The second involves an act of choice of pushing a person down, who would otherwise not have been involved in the situation at all. So to choose on his behalf, would involve him in something that he otherwise would have escaped.
    - In the first case where the three parties, the driver and the two sets of drivers are already in the situation.

    - in the first case, You have to make a certain choice and people are going to die because of the trolley car not necessarily because of your direct actions, You are making a split second decision. Whereas in the second case, pushing the fat man over is an actual act of murder on your part - You have control over that, whereas you may not have control over the trolley cart.

    - Either way you have to choose who dies. because chosing to turn and kill a person which is a act of conscious thought.

    - Pushing someone to death is different from steering something that is going to cause death

    - For some reasons that seems more wrong.
    - in the first case you are involved directly with the situation, whereas in the second, you're an onlooker. So you have the choice of being involved or not.
    - "1 life vs 5" - same reason I assume.
    - she answered she would kill the 5 people because it was their fault for working in that track despite knowing that train may arrive at that time. while the 1 worker was working on the side track as he knew train will not come on that track. 

    - Thats a great idea except for the fact that you wrecked the whole philosophical point.

    - Lets step back from these stories and arguments to notice a couple of things about the way the arguments have began to unfold.

    - Certain moral principles have begun to emerge from the discussions we had.

    -  people gestured towards having to do with the intrinsic quality of the act itself.

    People were reluctant,they thought it was just wrong, categorically wrong to kill a inoccent person

    - "Philosophy teaches us and unsettles us by confronting us with what we know "

    - "Philosophy estranges us from the familiar not by supplying new information but by inviting and provoking a new way of seeing"

    - the hypotheticals with which we began with their mix of playfulness and sobriety.

    - once familiar turns strange, its never quite te same again.
    - Self-knowledge is like lost innocence.


---------

- The right thing to do depends on the consequences that will result from your action

- `MORAL REASONING` 
    - CONSEQUENTIALIST - Locates morality in the consequences of an act. eg. utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham

    - CATEGORICAL -  Locates morality in certain duties and rights. eg. Emmanuel Kant
