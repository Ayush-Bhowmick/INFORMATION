# SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION

## GENERAL INFO:- 
- Pathway analysis in biochemistry
- In `ophthalmology`, `high-energy visible light (HEV light)` is high-frequency, released by computer , screens high-energy light in the violet/blue band from 400 to 500 nm in the visible spectrum. HEV light has been suggested as a cause of age-related macular degeneration.
